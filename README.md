**NOTE:** Unfortunately this project will stop working by the end of 2021, unless I find another weather API, because the best free weather API, DarkSky, is being [shut down](https://blog.darksky.net/).

This project was created with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) and uses the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev).
